## Introduction
The **Hospital Appointment System** is designed to help patients conveniently book appointments with doctors based on their availability. It streamlines the appointment scheduling process, reduces waiting times, and provides a user-friendly and responsive system accessible to all users, including those with disabilities. The application supports multiple user roles, including patients, doctors, and administrators.

### Key Goals:
- Enable patients to book, cancel, and manage appointments.
- Allow patients to view their appointment history and upcoming bookings, ensuring they are well-informed and prepared for their visits.
- Provide administrators with tools to manage doctors, patients, and appointment schedules.
